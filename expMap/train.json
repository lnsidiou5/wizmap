    "262": "The weekend was perfect in every way , in large part to Sue and her great staff .",
    "263": "Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well .",
    "264": "We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B&B ... especially my 4 year old , who made friends with Ms. Sue and all the ladies , and has talked about them since we left !",
    "265": "We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe !",
    "266": "B&B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June .",
    "267": "They were very polite , eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence .",
    "268": "Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying \" Workmanship is guaranteed for a year ! \" .",
    "269": "Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in .",
    "270": "We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of .",
    "271": "We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he 'd send someone out to look at it but could n't promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .",
    "272": "I just called again and was told that workmanship , not wood , is guaranteed for a year - well in my opinion - the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship !",
    "273": "She even went so far as to say \" You r calling about one board ? \"",
    "274": "Well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!",
    "275": "I WAS calling about one board !!",
    "276": "I 'm very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .",
    "277": "So I figure if they do n't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I 'll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money !!!",
    "278": "STAY AWAY !!!",
    "279": "They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why !!!",
    "280": "When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !",
    "281": "Never had a problem with the staff and found them very helpful when something went wrong .",

    "296": "I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .",
    "297": "Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .",
    "298": "My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus !",
    "299": "I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I did n't feel comfortable driving an SUV .",
    "300": "Gerry pleasantly said \" since I am already here why do n't we give it shot .",
    "301": "Gerry , I ca n't thank you enough for helping me cope with my fear .",
    "302": "To my friend , thank you for your recommendation ... you were true to your words in saying Gerry is a \" Saintly Instructor ... Absolutely Simple the Best Instructor and Best Driving school there is !",

    "310": "I hope to be back !",
    "311": "Quit with the overstatements !",
    "312": "The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that \" everyone \" is going to \" love \" the food , decor and service .",
    "313": "The truth is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food .",
    "314": "Now , the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal .",
    "315": "The salatim salads are the smallest plates I 've ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it were n't explained to you ) .",
    "316": "Though they are mostly excellent , you generally do n't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them .",
    "317": "Then again , for the three of us who dined together , two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more , and licking the hummus from our fingers ( and yes , those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three - person order ) .",
    "318": "The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .",
    "319": "The warm chocolate cake was very tasty , but served at room temperature , not warm by any stretch of the imagination .",
    "320": "Service was average , but nothing special , and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .",
    "321": "Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ) , we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .",
    "322": "But one should not go here expecting something fantastic , unless perhaps you 've never had middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts .",
    "323": "PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5:00 and 9:30 were their only openings .",

    "329": "I 've had 2 cuts now from Georgia and have paid more in other salons / barbershops and have not received this kind of treatment or cut !",
    "330": "But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .",
    "331": "My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery , So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit .",
    "332": "Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .",
    "333": "The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude .",

    "375": "Had to keep in mind that the A / C broke , I feel bad it was their opening !",
    "376": "We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .",
    "377": "The other rolls were n't at all special , especially given their pricing .",
